# Popper

>*In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be
> falsifiable; and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about
> reality.  (Karl Popper)*

*Popper* is an OCaml library that can be used for writing simple *unit-tests*
as well as *property-based* ones. Its underlying design is inspired by the Python library
[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

High-level features of Popper include:

- A uniform API for defining unit and property-based tests.
- Compositional design — tests and test suites can be nested arbitrarily.
- Ships with a `ppx` for automatically deriving *comparator* and *sample* functions for custom data types.
- Embedded shrinking - invariants that were used when constructing test data for property-based tests are always respected.
- Colorful output (sorry [Alcotest](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest), but couldn't resist the inspiration).
- Support for line-number reporting, timing information and debugging. 

## Getting started

- A [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) for covering the various features.

- Or, check out the examples in the [examples](examples) folder.

## An example

Here's what the test output might look like:

It was generated from the following code:

```ocaml
open Popper
open Sample.Syntax

type exp =
  | Lit of bool
  | And of exp * exp
  | Or of exp * exp
  | Not of exp
[@@deriving show, ord, popper]

let rec eval = function
  | Lit b -> b
  | And (e1, e2) -> eval e1 || eval e2
  | Or (e1, e2) -> eval e1 || eval e2
  | Not b -> not @@ eval b

(* A simple unit test *)
let test_hello_world =
  test @@ fun () ->
    equal Comparator.string "hello world" (String.lowercase_ascii "Hello World")

(* Another unit test *)
let test_lit_true = test @@ fun () -> is_true (eval (Lit true) = true)

(* A property-based test *)
let test_false_ident_or =
  test @@ fun () ->
    let* e = sample_exp in
    is_true (eval e = eval (Or (Lit false, e)))

(* Another property-based test *)
let test_true_ident_and =
  test @@ fun () ->
    let* e = Sample.with_log "e" pp_exp sample_exp in
    is_true ~loc:__LOC__ (eval e = eval (And (Lit true, e)))

let suite =
  suite
    [ ("Hello World", test_hello_world)
    ; ("Lit true", test_lit_true)
    ; ("False ident or", test_false_ident_or)
    ; ("True ident and", test_true_ident_and)
    ]

let () = run suite
```

## Comparing with other libraries

Popper was designed with to objectives in mind:

1. Make it as seamless as possible to write property-based tests (for instance by using a ppx to derive custom sample functions).
2. Use embedded shrinking (ala [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and eliminate the need for writing *shrinkers* manually.


The property based aspects overlap with the existing libraries [QCheck](https://github.com/c-cube/qcheck) and
[Crowbar](https://github.com/stedolan/crowbar).

Popper also supports writing simple unit tests and the
ability to compose tests into suites. This API and the output is inspired by
the unit testing library [Alcotest](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest).

Here's a table comparing features across different OCaml testing libraries:
