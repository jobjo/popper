# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed and done by creating a Pull Request to be landed on
the `main` branch!

See  [open issues](https://github.com/jobjo/popper/issues). The ones labeled
with `good first issue` may be a good start if you're new to the project.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions open a [new
issue](https://github.com/jobjo/popper/issues/new) or get in touch over email.

## Building

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jobjo/popper.git
cd popper
opam install -t --deps-only .
```

There are a few Make targets for convenience:

- `make test` — build project and execute tests.
- `make examples` — build and run examples.
- `make clean` — clean.
- `make format` — runs `ocamlformat` on all files.
- `make api-docs` - build api documentation using `dune build @doc`
- `make serve-docs` - serve non-api documentation from localhost (requires [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
- `make publish-docs` - commits latest api and *mkdocs* documentation on the `gh-pages` branch.

In order to build and test the documentation you need to install
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

You also need the [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) plugin:

```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

To generate and serve the docs, run `make serve-docs` and view at
[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
